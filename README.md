# BlockChain A-Z Part 3
## You Can Follow My Own All Research About Blockchain If You Are A Complete Beginner

# Writer Intro
I am **Subham Maity**
I love Programming. One of the aims I had when I started ```CodeXam``` was to make learning programming easy.

Actually, I was working on this project then I did research and made many projects, and then I thought why not make a detailed documentary on it then I started making the documentary which is completely free .

# Solidity Fundamentals

## What is Solidity? 
```javascript
1. Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart
contracts.

2. High-level statically typed programming language.

3. Case-sensitive.

4. With Solidity, you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding,
blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.
```
### note
```javascript
You should follow established -
development best-practices when writing your smart contracts.
```

# Solidity Compilation Process

### ABI
```javascript
The Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI) 
is the standard way to interact with contracts 
in the Ethereum ecosystem, both from outside the 
blockchain and for contract-to-contract interaction. 
Data is encoded according to its type, 
as described in this specification.
```
#### ABI is a bridge between an application and sol file ( to communicate source.sol file ) without ABI of our solidity file communication is impossible 

### Byte Code

Smart contract code is usually written in a high level programming language such as Solidity. This code gets compiled to something called the EVM bytecode which gets deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. This is very similar to a programming language like Java where the code gets converted to JVM Byte code.
